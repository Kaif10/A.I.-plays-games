# Training AI to play games.

I created a fun flappy-ball game with Python library Pygame which makes building games so easier and then coded the 'NEAT Algorithm'
which is a type on Neural Network to play the game by itself. After a lot of training my Neural Network was able to achieve high scores 
beating human level performances.
